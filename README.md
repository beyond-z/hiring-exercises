# Career Manager - Exercises for Hiring Software Engineers
A set of tools and features to help Braven Fellows and Alumni manage their careers, especially in terms of getting their first job out of college.


## Setup

### Docker (preferred)

Using docker, it's very easy to get the application up and running. We don't even need to worry about keeping database passwords out of the repo, because Docker will spin up a database that only this application has access to, on a private network.

First, we need to copy a couple of environment files in the app directory:

    cp .env.example .env
    cp .env.database.example .env.database

Again, you don't really need to change the database passwords in these files, so we're doing this mainly to conform to "best practices" for Rails apps in general. But if you do want to pick a different database password, make sure it matches in both files.

Now fire up and build the docker environment. This will create/launch the Rails app, as well as a PostgreSQL database server for the app to use:

    docker-compose up -d

This will take a while the first time, because Docker has to download a Ruby image and a PostgreSQL image and set them up. It will also install all the necessary Ruby gems that the app requires.

Now create the needed databases.

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rake db:create db:schema:load db:init db:seed

We've configured Docker to run our Rails app on port 3010, so go to http://localhost:3010 in your favorite browser. If everything's working correctly, you should be brought to a login page. Login with career.admin@bebraven.org with password test1234. If that works, you should see a page with a list of Opportunities, Fellows, Industries, etc.

**For the hiring exercises, you can STOP here when setting up your development environment. The rest of this is just extra to help you actually complete the exercise.**

To see the Fellow experience (as opposed to admin), open up `docs/TestFellowAccount_SoftwareEngineerHiring.csv`, change `<insertyouremail>` in Column D to your actual email, save and upload the .csv under the Fellows page from the admin dashboard (accessed above). Finally, email the Braven tech team with the user name and email to add to the staging environment so you can login.

To interact with the app in the console, run this:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rails c

As you may have guessed, running the app through Docker does have the drawback of having to pre-pend "docker-compose exec career-mgr" to every rails/rake command. If you're in a unix-y environment (and Mac OS X counts) you can add this alias to your ~/.bash-profile file:

    alias career="docker-compose exec career-mgr"

Be sure to re-source this file in any open console windows to get it to work. Now you can issue rails/rake commands like so:

    # launch rails console
    career rails c
    
    # run database migrations
    career rake db:migrate

## Post-Setup

At least once, you should load the database with valid zip codes and metro areas. The import files are not in the repo, they're too large. They're located in Google Drive:

* `postal-codes.csv`: https://drive.google.com/a/bebraven.org/file/d/1uyhCoe7BB4mTfFa8vmcG9udln5VQ9d8v/view?usp=sharing
* `msa.txt`: https://drive.google.com/a/bebraven.org/file/d/16oM_ZJXogOBtz9U6MDEaZXzW6fn4AMog/view?usp=sharing

Copy them to the `tmp`, then:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rake postal:load

This will allow the app to calculate distances between fellows and opportunities, and will generate all the needed metro areas for fellow/opp matching.

## Continuing Development

If you restarted your OS, it's usually a good thing to restart the Docker app.

Whenever you pull in changes from upstream, you should run the following commands in the root directory of the app: 

    docker-compose build career-mgr
    docker-compose stop career-mgr
    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate career-mgr
    docker-compose up -d
    
    docker-compose exec career-mgr rake db:migrate
   
    docker-compose exec career-mgr rspec

If you make updates to `Gemfile` on your own, run the first group of commands above. If you create migrations of your own, run the `rake db:migrate` command to update the database.

Periodically, run rspec to ensure that you haven't broken any existing tests with your code changes. And you should be adding your own tests, right? ;) Definitely run rspec before creating a pull request.

If you'd like to reset the database to the original seed data (with example employers, industries, and interests), you can re-run this command at any time:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rake db:seed

...or go all out with this one:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rake db:drop db:create db:schema:load db:init db:seed

## Troubleshooting

* `HTTPError Could not fetch specs from https://rubygems.org/` - Restart docker.
* If rspec fails with a `PendingMigrationError`, run this: `docker-compose exec career-mgr rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` (sometimes you may need to run it more than once)

## Testing

You can run the test suite like so:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr rspec

You can open a dedicated terminal window and have tests run automatically as you code:

    docker-compose exec career-mgr guard

## A/B Testing

We're using the [Split](https://github.com/splitrb/split) gem to manage A/B testing. The gem's README is very good, but here are the MCM-unique pieces. This has nothing to do with automated unit/integration tests - it's about seeing which variations in the UX result in more of a desired result.

### Dashboard Authentication

You must be logged in with an admin account, which by default is any bebraven.org account. This is implemented with some routing voodoo in the `routes.rb` file.

### Configuration

All tests (called "experiments") are listed in the `config/experiments.yml` file. Experiments *can* be created ad hoc within the application, but shouldn't be. This gives us one defined place for all current experiments.

### Basic A/B Testing Flow

1. Add to `config/experiments.yml` file
2. Include custom testing code in views/controllers per Split's documentation
3. Include a way to "complete" an experiment (like when a user clicks "buy now", which indicates the test worked)
4. Let the experiment run, checking the dashboard at `/split` for results
5. When a "best choice" has been identified, click this choice's "use this" button
6. Go back and remove all code related to this experiment in the experiments config, views, and controllers; replace with the static "winning" choice

### Non-Browser A/B Tests

Browser-based experiments are easy, and well outlined in Split's documentation. But we need to test things like e-mail subjects as well. These are tied to our `AccessToken`s via our custom `AccessTokenSplit` class. This class takes an access token, which every outgoing e-mail has, and uses it to gain access to the necessary variables (like opportunity name) in the experiment itself. This does the custom work of creating/finishing experiment in a way that doesn't rely on automatic browser flow of assigning users to experiment groups in the view, because e-mails don't have cookies and browser sessions.

Because this is custom and slightly complicated, here's a full example. In `config/experiments.yml`:

    invitation:
      alternatives:
        - simple
        - question
        - verbose
      goals:
        - accept
        - decline
      metadata:
        simple:
          subject: "We found something."
        question:
          subject: "Are you interested in the <%= @token.owner.opportunity.name %> role?"
        verbose:
          subject: "We found an opportunity for you! It's the <%= @token.owner.opportunity.name %> role. Are you interested? Do you like turtles??"

We've defined an experiment called "invitation". Now we use this experiment in our mailer subject:

    class SimpleMailer < ApplicationMailer
      add_template_helper(ApplicationHelper)
    
      def respond_to_invitation
        @split = AccessTokenSplit.new(params[:access_token], 'invitation')
        mail(to: @fellow.contact.email, subject: interpolate(@split.settings['subject']))
      end
    
      private
    
      def interpolate string
        ERB.new(string || '').result(binding).html_safe
      end
    end

Okay, we have a few things going on here. First, this mailer expects an access token to be passed in as a parameter. This particular token describes the relationship between a fellow and an opportunity, so the token's "owner" is the `fellow_opportunity` model, which has access to both the fellow and the opportunity. We leveraged this in some of the e-mail subject versions of our experiment. 

In order to use ERB-style notation in the YAML file, we have to use an `interpolate` method which pumps the raw string through the ERB interpreter, passing in the current binding. A "binding" in Ruby is the current scope which includes all the currently defined variables like `@token`. Otherwise, the ERB interpreter itself wouldn't know what `@token` means. We wouldn't need this step if the subjects didn't contain dynamic elements.

Now our mailer template would need to include a couple of links, one for each "goal" (or choice):

    <a href="/accept?access_token=123">Accept</a>
    <a href="/decline?access_token=123">Decline</a>

The access token parameter is very important - this is how Split will know which version of the experiment the user interacted with.

Now we have to *complete* the experiment when a given user does what we're hoping they do, like click the "accept" button:

    class SimpleController < ApplicationController
      def accept
        experiment = AccessTokenSplit.new(params[:access_token], 'invitation')
        experiment.finish('accept')
      end
      
      def decline
        experiment = AccessTokenSplit.new(params[:access_token], 'invitation')
        experiment.finish('decline')
      end
    end

Here, we re-load the same experiment based on the access token. Now that we have the correct a/b test loaded, we call `finish`, passing in which goal was completed (or, which choice the user made), and we're done. If our a/b test doesn't have multiple goals, we can just call `experiment.finish` with no parameter.

Now, the experiment works like any browser-based experiment, and you can view the results in the Split dashboard.

## Conclusion

This README will be updated as the app gets fleshed out and more complicated. For now, enjoy the magic of an app that does nothing, but in a very sophisticated way - requiring no special drivers, libraries, or database servers, or versions of ruby to be installed on your system directly. Magic!
